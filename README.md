# G935 GHub replacement for linux

This is based almost entirely on [g933-utils by ashkitten](https://github.com/ashkitten/g933-utils).

I made it only for myself, but feel free to use it, if its useful to you.

The library crate in `lib.rs` and other files except `main.rs` is responsible for dealing with all low-level things, whereas the binary crate in `main.rs` is responsible for the configuration.
